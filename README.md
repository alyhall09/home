This project looks at ASOS station data across the Northeastern United States. Date, time, precipitation amount and present weather codes are used to determine rates of precipitation in millimeters per hour (where precipitation occurs) over the winter season. 


### Dependencies:

* astral
* cartopy.crs
* cartopy.feature
* datetime
* matplotlib.pyplot
* numpy
* pandas
* pytz


### Executing program

* One appropriate station data is downloaded, import data to file and run.
* Files with prefix 'yearly' include all winter weather precipitation at that location.
* Files with prefix 'snow' only include winter snow amounts at that location.
* Cumulative and Snowcumulative show all station data for all precipitation and snow only precipitation respectively.
